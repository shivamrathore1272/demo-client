                Early use Scientists are still debating when people started wearing clothes. Estimates by various experts have
                ranged from 40,000 to 3 million years ago. Some more recent studies involving the evolution of body lice have
                implied a more recent development with some indicating a development of around 170,000 years ago and others
                indicating as little as 40,000. No single estimate is widely accepted.[1][2][3][4] Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser
                and Mark Stoneking, anthropologists at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, conducted a
                genetic analysis of human body lice that suggests clothing originated around 170,000 years ago. Body lice are an
                indicator of clothes-wearing, since most humans have sparse body hair, and lice thus require human clothing to
                survive. Their research suggests that the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward migration
                of modern Homo sapiens away from the warm climate of Africa, thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000
                years ago. However, a second group of researchers using similar genetic methods estimate that clothing
                originated around 540,000 years ago.[5] According to archaeologists and anthropologists, the earliest clothing
                likely consisted of fur, leather, leaves, or grass that were draped, wrapped, or tied around the body. Knowledge
                of such clothing remains inferential, since clothing materials deteriorate quickly compared to stone, bone,
                shell and metal artifacts. Archeologists have identified very early sewing needles of bone and ivory from about
                30,000 BC, found near Kostenki, Russia in 1988.[6] Dyed flax fibers that could have been used in clothing have
                been found in a prehistoric cave in the Republic of Georgia that date back to 34,000 BC.[7][8] Making clothing
                See also: Garment industry, knitting, and weaving Sari Hindu Indian lady wearing sari, painting by Raja Ravi
                Varma. One of the most ancient and popular pieces of clothing in the Indian subcontinent Some human cultures,
                such as the various peoples of the Arctic Circle, traditionally make their clothing entirely of prepared and
                decorated furs and skins. Other cultures supplemented or replaced leather and skins with cloth: woven, knitted,
                or twined from various animal and vegetable fibers including wool, linen, cotton, silk, hemp, and ramie.
                Although modern consumers may take the production of clothing for granted, making fabric by hand is a tedious
                and labor-intensive process involving fiber making, spinning, and weaving. The textile industry was the first to
                be mechanized – with the powered loom – during the Industrial Revolution. Different cultures have evolved
                various ways of creating clothes out of cloth. One approach simply involves draping the cloth. Many people wore,
                and still wear, garments consisting of rectangles of cloth wrapped to fit – for example, the dhoti for men and
                the sari for women in the Indian subcontinent, the Scottish kilt and the Javanese sarong. The clothes may simply
                be tied up (dhoti and sari); or pins or belts hold the garments in place (kilt and sarong). The cloth remains
                uncut, and people of various sizes can wear the garment. Another approach involves measuring, cutting, and
                sewing the cloth by hand or with a sewing machine. Clothing can be cut from a sewing pattern and adjusted by a
                tailor to the wearer's measurements. An adjustable sewing mannequin or dress form is used to create form-fitting
                clothing. If the fabric is expensive, the tailor tries to use every bit of the cloth rectangle in constructing
                the clothing; perhaps cutting triangular pieces from one corner of the cloth, and adding them elsewhere as
                gussets. Traditional European patterns for men's shirts and women's chemises take this approach. These remnants
                can also be reused to make patchwork hats, vests, and skirts. Modern European fashion treats cloth much less
                conservatively, typically cutting in such a way as to leave various odd-shaped cloth remnants. Industrial sewing
                operations sell these as waste; home sewers may turn them into quilts. In the thousands of years that humans
                have been making clothing, they have created an astonishing array of styles, many of which have been
                reconstructed from surviving garments, photos, paintings, mosaics, etc., as well as from written descriptions.
                Costume history can inspire current fashion designers, as well as costumiers for plays, films, television, and
                historical reenactment. Functions A baby wearing many items of winter clothing: headband, cap, fur-lined coat,

                miniskirt, shorts and romper, all worn by the same model The most obvious function of clothing is to protect the
                wearer from the elements. In hot weather, clothing provides protection from sunburn or wind damage. In the cold,
                it offers thermal insulation. Shelter can reduce the functional need for clothing. For example, coats, hats,
                gloves and other outer layers are normally removed when entering a warm place. Similarly, clothing has seasonal
                and regional aspects so that thinner materials and fewer layers of clothing are generally worn in warmer regions
                and seasons than in colder ones. Further information: [[: Clothing comfort]] Clothing has been made from a very
                wide variety of materials, ranging from leather and furs to woven fabrics to elaborate and exotic natural and
                synthetic fabrics. Not all body coverings are regarded as clothing. Articles carried rather than worn (such as
                purses), worn on a single part of the body and easily removed (scarves), worn purely for adornment (jewelry), or
                those that serve a function other than protection (eyeglasses), are normally considered accessories rather than
                clothing. Clothing protects against many things that might injure or irritate the uncovered human body,
                including rain, snow, wind, and other weather, as well as from the sun. Garments that are too sheer, thin, small
                or tight offer less protection. Appropriate clothes can also reduce risk during activities such as work or
                sport. Some clothing protects from specific hazards, such as insects, noxious chemicals, weather, weapons, and
                contact with abrasive substances. Humans have devised clothing solutions to environmental or other hazards: such
                as space suits, air conditioned clothing, armor, diving suits, swimsuits, bee-keeper gear, motorcycle leathers,
                high-visibility clothing, and other pieces of protective clothing. The distinction between clothing and
                protective equipment is not always clear-cut, since clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective
                value and clothes designed for function often consider fashion in their design. The choice of clothes also has
                social implications. They cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered, act as a form of
                adornment, and serve other social purposes. Someone who lacks the means to procure reasonable clothing due to
                poverty or affordability, or simply lack of inclination, is sometimes said to be scruffy, ragged, or shabby.[9]
                Clothing performs a range of social and cultural functions, such as individual, occupational and gender
                differentiation, and social status.[10] In many societies, norms about clothing reflect standards of modesty,
                religion, gender, and social status. Clothing may also function as adornment and an expression of personal taste
                or style. Scholarship Function of clothing Serious books on clothing and its functions appear from the 19th
                century as imperialists dealt with new environments such as India and the tropics.[11] Some scientific research
                into the multiple functions of clothing in the first half of the 20th century, with publications such as J.C.
                Flügel's Psychology of Clothes in 1930,[10] and Newburgh's seminal Physiology of Heat Regulation and The Science
                of Clothing in 1949.[12] By 1968, the field of environmental physiology had advanced and expanded significantly,
                but the science of clothing in relation to environmental physiology had changed little.[13] There has since been
                considerable research, and the knowledge base has grown significantly, but the main concepts remain unchanged,
                and indeed Newburgh's book is still cited by contemporary authors, including those attempting to develop
                thermoregulatory models of clothing development.[14][further explanation needed] History of clothing Clothing
                reveals much about human history. According to Professor Kiki Smith of Smith College, garments preserved in
                collections are resources for study similar to books and paintings.[15] Scholars around the world have studied a
                wide range of topics, including the history of specific items of clothing [16],[17]clothing styles in different
                cultural groups[18] and the business of clothing and fashion.[19] The textile curator Linda Baumgarten writes
                that "clothing provides a remarkable picture of the daily lives, beliefs, expectations, and hopes of those who
                lived in the past. [20] Clothing presents a number of challenges to historians. Clothing made of textiles or
                skins are subject to decay, and the erosion of physical integrity can be seen as a loss of cultural
                information.[21] Costume collections often focus on important pieces of clothing considered unique or otherwise
                significant, limiting the opportunities scholars have to study everyday clothing.[22]`);
